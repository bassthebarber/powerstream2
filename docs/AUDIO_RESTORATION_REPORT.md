---

| Master Engine | ✅ Fixed | API payload alignment |

---

## Phase 1: Beat Generation + Playback

### Files Modified

**Backend:**
- `backend/recordingStudio/RecordingStudioServer.js`
  - Added static file serving for `/api/beats/download/`
  - Added static file serving for `/api/mix/download/`
  - Added static file serving for `/api/studio/master/download/`
  - Added static file serving for `/api/recordings/download/`
  - Created output directories at server startup

### How It Works Now

1. Beat generation saves files to `output/beats/`
2. Server serves files via Express static middleware
3. CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin audio access
4. URLs return proper `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`

---

## Phase 2: Loop Generation Playback

### Changes

Loop playback was already wired correctly. Verified:
- Loops are generated via the beat engine
- Pattern data is returned for sequencer
- Audio URLs work with the new static serving

---

## Phase 3: Recording Booth Playback ("Hear Yourself")

### Files Created

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/studio-app/src/hooks/useAudioMonitor.js` (NEW)
  - Full WebAudio monitoring pipeline
  - MediaStreamSource → GainNode → CompressorNode → Analyser → Destination
  - Real-time level metering
  - Mute/unmute toggle (disconnects gain, not nodes)
  - Beat loading and playback integration
  - Low-latency settings:
    ```javascript
    {
      echoCancellation: false,
      noiseSuppression: false,
      autoGainControl: false,
      latency: 0
    }
    ```

### Files Modified

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/studio-app/src/hooks/useAudioRecorder.js`
  - Added `micLevel` state for real-time meter
  - Added WebAudio analyser for level detection
  - Added low-latency mic settings
  - Proper cleanup on unmount

- `frontend/studio-app/src/BeatPlayer.jsx`
  - Complete rewrite with proper audio handling
  - Integration with useAudioMonitor
  - URL normalization via beatPlayerService
  - Visual level meter
  - Monitor toggle button
  - Proper error handling

### How It Works Now

1. Artist clicks "Start Recording"
2. useAudioMonitor starts WebAudio pipeline
3. Mic audio routes through: Source → Gain → Compressor → Analyser → Destination
4. Beat plays simultaneously through separate chain
5. Artist hears both beat + their voice in real-time
6. Recording is saved separately without the monitoring chain

---

## Phase 4: Mix & Master Suite 400 Fix

### Root Cause

Frontend was not sending required `audioUrl` field to backend.

### Files Modified

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/lib/studioApi.js`
  - `applyMix()` - Added required `audioUrl` parameter
  - Added `combineMix()` function for vocal + beat
  - Added `getMixList()` function
  - `applyMastering()` - Added required `audioUrl` and `preset` parameters
  - Added `getMasteringPresets()` function
  - Added `downloadMaster()` function
  - Added input validation with clear error messages

### New API Contract

**POST /api/mix/apply**
```json
{
  "audioUrl": "https://...", // REQUIRED
  "projectName": "Mix Name",
  "settings": {
    "bass": 0,
    "mid": 0,
    "treble": 0,
    "presence": 0,
    "comp": 2,
    "limiter": -1,
    "volume": 0
  }
}
```

**POST /api/studio/master/apply**
```json
{
  "audioUrl": "https://...", // REQUIRED
  "preset": "streaming", // streaming, club, broadcast, cd, loud, vinyl
  "projectName": "Master Name",
  "settings": { // Optional overrides
    "loudness": -14,
    "stereoWidth": 100
  }
}
```

## Phase 5: New Files Created

### Services

- `frontend/studio-app/src/services/beatPlayerService.js`
  - `normalizeAudioUrl()` - Converts relative URLs to absolute
  - `validateAudioUrl()` - HEAD request to verify URL works
  - `createAudioElement()` - Creates Audio with proper settings
  - `loadAudio()` - Promise-based audio loading
  - `BeatPlayer` class - Full playback control

### Test Page

- `frontend/studio-app/src/AudioSystemTest.jsx`
  - Interactive test page for all audio systems
  - Tests AudioContext initialization
  - Tests microphone access
  - Tests monitoring start/stop
  - Tests beat engine health
  - Tests mix engine health
  - Tests master engine health
  - Tests URL normalization
  - Can generate and play test beat
  - Live monitor status display

## Phase 6: No Regressions

### Verified NOT Changed

- ✅ PowerFeed - Not touched
- ✅ PowerGram - Not touched
- ✅ PowerReel - Not touched
- ✅ PowerLine - Not touched
- ✅ TV Stations - Not touched
- ✅ Menus - Not touched
- ✅ Auth - Not touched
- ✅ Sockets - Not touched

---

## How to Verify

### 1. Beat Playback Test

```bash
# Start studio backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# In browser console:
const audio = new Audio("http://localhost:5100/api/beats/download/beat_test.mp3");
audio.play();
```

### 2. Recording Booth Test

1. Navigate to `/player` in studio app
2. Load any beat URL
3. Click "Monitor (Hear Yourself)"
4. Speak into mic - you should hear yourself
5. Click "Start Recording"
6. Record vocal, stop, download

### 3. Mix/Master Test

1. Navigate to PowerHarmony Mastering Suite
2. Load audio
3. Select preset (streaming, club, etc.)
4. Click "AI Master"
5. Verify audio is returned
6. Click "Export Master" to download

### 4. Run Automated Tests

Navigate to `/audio-test` in the studio app to run all automated tests.

## Environment Requirements

For full AI audio generation:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MUSICGEN_API_BASE=http://your-musicgen-server
```

For audio storage:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

Without these, the system uses pattern-based fallback (no audio file, just drum grid data).

## Summary

| System | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Beat files | 404 not found | ✅ Served via static middleware |
| Beat URLs | Relative, broken | ✅ Normalized to absolute |
| Mic monitoring | No audio output | ✅ Full WebAudio pipeline |
| Latency | High (echo cancellation on) | ✅ Low (disabled processing) |
| Mix API | 400 missing fields | ✅ Proper payload with validation |
| Master API | 400 missing fields | ✅ Proper payload with presets |
| Level meters | Not working | ✅ Real-time FFT analysis |
