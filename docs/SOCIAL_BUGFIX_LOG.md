# PowerStream Social Features - Bugfix Log

## Date: December 2024

## Overview
This document logs all bugs fixed during the POWERSTREAM SOCIAL QA + BUGFIX pass.

---

## 🔧 Backend Fixes

### 1. Upload Route Fixed (`backend/routes/uploadRoutes.js`)
**Problem:** The upload route only had a health check endpoint. Calls to `POST /api/upload` were failing.

**Fix:** Implemented full file upload handler with:
- Multer memory storage for file handling
- Cloudinary integration for production uploads
- Base64 fallback for development (when Cloudinary not configured)
- Separate endpoints for `/upload`, `/upload/image`, `/upload/video`
- Auth middleware protection on upload endpoints

---

### 2. PowerFeed Controller Fixed (`backend/controllers/powerFeedController.js`)
**Problem:** `createPost` required `userId` in the request body, but the frontend was sending the auth token which the middleware decodes into `req.user`.

**Fixes:**
- `createPost`: Now uses `req.user.id` from auth middleware (with fallback to `req.body.userId` for backwards compatibility)
- `reactToPost`: Now uses `req.user.id` for the user performing the like
- `commentOnPost`: Now uses `req.user.id` and `req.user.name` for the commenter
- Added `likesCount` to react response
- Added `createdAt` timestamp to comments

---

### 3. PowerGram Controller Fixed (`backend/controllers/powerGramController.js`)
**Problem:** `createGram` required `userId` in the request body.

**Fixes:**
- Now uses `req.user.id` from auth middleware
- Accepts both `imageUrl` and `mediaUrl` for flexibility
- Parses hashtags from string format (e.g., "#tag1 #tag2")
- Added `location` and `mediaType` fields support

---

### 4. PowerReel Routes Fixed (`backend/routes/powerReelRoutes.js`)
**Problem:** Missing `GET /:id/comments` endpoint for fetching reel comments.

**Fixes:**
- Added `GET /:id/comments` route mapped to `getReelComments`
- Added auth middleware to protected routes (POST operations)
- Public routes: `GET /`, `GET /:id/comments`, `POST /:id/view`
- Protected routes: `POST /`, `POST /:id/like`, `POST /:id/comment`

---

### 5. PowerFeed Routes Updated (`backend/routes/powerFeedRoutes.js`)
**Problem:** Routes lacked auth middleware protection.

**Fix:** Added `authRequired` middleware to:
- `POST /posts` (create post)
- `POST /posts/:id/react` (like/react)
- `POST /posts/:id/comment` (add comment)

---

### 6. PowerGram Routes Updated (`backend/routes/powerGramRoutes.js`)
**Problem:** Routes lacked auth middleware protection; missing `GET /:id/comments` endpoint.

**Fixes:**
- Added `GET /:id/comments` route
- Added `authRequired` middleware to protected routes
- Public routes: `GET /`, `GET /:id/comments`
- Protected routes: `POST /`, `POST /:id/like`, `POST /:id/comment`

---

### 7. PowerLine Routes Updated (`backend/routes/powerLineRoutes.js`)
**Problem:** Routes lacked auth middleware.

**Fix:** Added `router.use(authRequired)` to protect all PowerLine endpoints.
